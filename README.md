# surfs_up

W. Avy is hoping to open a surf shop in Oahu Hawaii and  wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically she wants the temperature data for the months of June and December. This will help them determine if the shop will be sustainable all year round.

## Results
#### Using Jupiter notebook and the program sqlalchemy we are able to obtain the statistical temperature data for both months June and Decemmber  in Oahu Hawaii.
#### June temperature data

#### December temperature data

 The average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees, while in December it is 71.0. Slightly cooler in December but still not a very big difference. Meaning it is still reasonable for outdoor recreation (surfing) and dining (ice cream).

There is also not much of a deviation in the max temperatures it reaches in both months. June max temp is 85 degrees while December max temp is 83 degrees.
We can also see that the minimum temps are a bit more deviated but I dont believe its enough the break the shop. 64 degrees in June and 56 degrees in December which is pretty chilly.

## Summary
From the results shown above we can determine that Oahu Hawii has ideal (or near ideal) temperatures throught the whole year to justify having a surf and ice cream shop.Oahu Hawaii seems to have a very consistent temperatures throughout the year. 

What other factors or data to look at to determine if this is the right location would be to collect data on the percipitation that occurs in Oahu Hawaii. Percipitation and as well wind speeds could serve as good data as surfing and ice cream eating tends to happen less frequent during undesirable weather conditions. 

Another Factor to look into would be to look at temperature and weather data at specific time of days. Specifaclly the time of day that most people tend to go surfing.
